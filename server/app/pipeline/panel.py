"""Panel footprint resolution.

`panel_mutation_density` (variants per megabase) needs the panel's genomic
footprint. That number can come from three sources, and which one was used is
always reported, because they are not equally trustworthy:

  1. `bed_supplied`   -- a BED uploaded with the request. Exact.
  2. `bed_configured` -- a BED provisioned server-side. Exact.
  3. `gene_span_estimate` -- the union of the observed genes' spans, from a
     locally provisioned gene-coordinate BED. An ESTIMATE: gene spans include
     introns, whereas a capture panel targets exons, so this overstates the
     footprint (understating density) by a large and variable factor.

If none are available, the footprint is None and density is simply omitted --
never approximated silently.
