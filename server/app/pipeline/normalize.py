"""bcftools norm wrapper -- decomposes multiallelic records and left-aligns
indels so coordinates match ClinVar's own normalized representation. This is
required before any ClinVar/CIViC coordinate join; skipping it silently
breaks those joins rather than raising a visible error.

Symbolic ALT (<DEL> etc.) records pass through largely unchanged by
`bcftools norm -m -any` -- they're matched by gene-overlap downstream, not
exact REF/ALT, so that's expected and not a bug in this step.

This module also exports `ensure_contig_headers()`, the single place that
reconciles two classes of VCF contig-naming problems, before they can
surface as confusing failures several pipeline stages later:

  1. A "chr1"-style upload against this codebase's bare-contig ("1")
     reference FASTAs (or vice versa) -- `bcftools norm` itself only warns
     about this, but fails fatally further downstream trying to fetch the
     sequence from the reference by its unreconciled name. Fixing this
     requires the reference FASTA's own .fai, to know the correct spelling
     to rename to.
  2. A VCF whose header omits (or incompletely declares) ##contig lines --
     permitted by the VCF spec, and tolerated elsewhere in this pipeline
     (validate.py warns rather than fails on it), but `bcftools sort` /
     `bcftools annotate` -- used downstream for the ClinVar/CIViC join --
     refuse to run at all against a record whose CHROM isn't declared in
     its own header. Fixing this does NOT require the reference -- it's
     just declaring what the file's own records already say -- so it still
     runs even if reference resources aren't provisioned on this deployment.

`normalize_vcf()` calls this on the raw upload before `bcftools norm` runs.
SnpEff, run between normalization and the ClinVar join, does not reliably
carry the injected declarations through to its own output -- so
`annotate_clinvar.py` calls `ensure_contig_headers()` again on SnpEff's
output before sorting it, rather than trusting an upstream tool it doesn't
control to preserve them.

    is written (same directory, same per-request workdir the caller already

    Two independent problems, only one of which needs the reference:
      - Renaming a "chr1"-style contig to the reference's own spelling (or
        vice versa) requires knowing that spelling, so it only happens when
        reference_fasta's .fai is actually present.
      - Declaring a contig the file already uses correctly, just without a
        ##contig header line for it, does not require any external
        reference at all -- it's just making the header describe what the
        body already says. This still runs even when the .fai is missing
        (e.g. reference resources not yet provisioned on this deployment),
        so `bcftools sort`/`annotate` downstream don't hard-fail over a
        resource gap that has nothing to do with header well-formedness.

    Safe to call more than once on the same logical file as it moves through
    the pipeline: each call re-checks the file it's actually handed, so it
    reconciles whatever gap exists at that point rather than assuming an
