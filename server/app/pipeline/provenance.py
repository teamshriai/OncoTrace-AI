"""Provenance mining (spec §1).

VCF headers record the commands that produced the file, and those commands name
external files the analysis depended on -- panel BEDs, reference FASTAs, other
VCFs. Those references are evidence about what the file *is*, and when one names
a panel BED we don't have, that's a concrete missing input rather than an
unknowable.

This stage extracts every referenced path and turns it into a checklist item
stating what it is, whether we have it, and what is degraded without it. Finding
that `bed/panel_fixed.bed` was referenced-but-absent previously took a human
reading the header by hand; it now happens on every ingest.
