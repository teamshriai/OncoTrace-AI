        'Cancer is not a fixed disease. It evolves over time, adapts to treatment, and can develop resistance. However, many traditional monitoring methods rely on periodic imaging or invasive biopsies — approaches that provide only occasional snapshots of a constantly changing condition.',
        'As oncology moves toward precision medicine, the need for realtime molecular monitoring has become increasingly important. Liquid biopsy technologies now allow us to track cancer non-invasively using blood samples. Two key biomarkers have emerged in this space: Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) and Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA).',
        'Both have strong scientific value. However, for building an AI-Powered Realtime Precision Monitoring platform, we have chosen to focus primarily on ctDNA — a choice reflecting biological evidence, clinical validation, data compatibility with AI systems, and practical scalability.'
